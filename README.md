# Voice-AI-Prototype
Machine learning program. Train the machine to read emotion based off of voice, take user input through voice, put it into a text file, and forward that to a downloaded chatbot.

This program is not near completion and wont be for a couple months. All I have as of right now is the voice being taken into a file and forwarded to a chatbot and the user can have a conversation with the chatbot. 
However, I still need to train the AI with a dataset I recieved from Kaggle.

chatbot: llama version 3.1
Kaggle dataset: Toronto emotional speech set (TESS)
